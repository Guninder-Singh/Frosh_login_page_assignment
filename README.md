# Frosh_login_page_assignment
This login page was made by me as I was asked to make it in the interview
This is an attempt made by guninder Singh Bhatia to make a login page for frosh as asked in interview. This page was made with use of HTML, CSS and a bit of javascript.
Maybe the expectations of the ones seeing might be high but I gave my best to make what I could. 
Making this page a great experince as it taught me many new things in a night which in normal case would have taken time.
This page is just an structure of a login page with some design and doesn't have any great backend included with it as I am still learning it.
I hope you understand that I am still in the learning phase of web dev but I gave my all to make it .
